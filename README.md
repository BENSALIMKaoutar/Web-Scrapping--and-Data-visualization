# Web-Scrapping--and-Data-visualization
This project is an application of my skills on web scrapping i've acquired, and the work have been done with my colleague [Noha BENABDELLAH](https://github.com/nohabenabdellah)
I've tried to collect data about books in a web site in order to generate some deductions about the most categorie readers tend to buy. We've tried as well to improve the rating efficiency.
